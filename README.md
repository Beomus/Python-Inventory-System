# A Lending System using Python and PyQt5
A simple lending system I built for my university work. It allows student staff to lend/return laptops much easier while also populating a database for future references.

## TODO
- Fix bugs that cause crashing while using the program
- Using a better database (Cloud-based, Google Sheets, SQL, etc.)
